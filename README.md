# My Avengers app

The assignment asks for use of Gulp, but as I don't have any significant experience with Gulp, and the contract is to use Angular2, I figured I would take advantage of the new Angular2 CLI, which provides some help in scaffolding, building and development.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.8.

## Getting started
```
git clone https://github.com/mikkelking/a2app.git
cd a2app
npm install
ng serve
```

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
